## TRAVEL BUBBLE   🌍🏝️🌀

## Description 🌎
Travel Bubble is the best app for your travels!
Did it ever happened to you that you had all your tours planned for a trip but forgot to assign a laundry day for your clothes? Well that is not a problem anymore with Travel Bubble. This initial app is dedicated to people who are willing to let travelers use their washing machine and drying machine for laundry porpuses. If you are looking for some extra income and make new friends this is the perfect app for you!


## USER STORY 👩‍✈️
As a person who had travel the world, I want an app for travelers to find all laundries nearby. Allow locals in the area to use their facility for laundry ONLY and with this earn an income but at the same time is a reasonable price for travelers.
